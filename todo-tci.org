* Sonic part
** [#A] dt can be different in each sonic file
** [#B] Shifting to the transmitter signal for each track
   May be different start-recording times and scaling
** [#C] Better automated arrival picking
   idea: create lines base on color gradients (maybe Hough
   transform), make the user pick the line that corresponds
   to the arrivals and another that corresponds to transmitting.
** DONE Add moduli/arrivals export

* General
** [#C] Make Windows executable
** Write tutorial + methodology section
** [#A] Add unit testing
** [#A] ComboList styles in styles file

   checkboxes empty (to workaround the auto-zoom bug).
** Certain features activate appropriate tab
** All actions need to work
** DONE Export actions need to be disabled when no data
