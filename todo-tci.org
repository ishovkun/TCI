* Sonic part
** TODO [#A] dt can be different in each sonic file
** TODO [#B] Shifting to the transmitter signal for each track
   May be different start-recording times and scaling
** TODO [#C] Better automated arrival picking

   transform), make the user pick the line that corresponds
   to the arrivals and another that corresponds to transmitting.

** TODO Make Windows executable
** TODO Write tutorial + methodology section
** TODO [#B] Make more elaborated README
