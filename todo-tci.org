*** TODO Add better handling of comment section
*** TODO Add exception handling
*** TODO Add reading sample length and other params (mass, density, porosity?)
** TODO [#C] Crosshair color (to stylesheet)
* Sonic part
** TODO Account for strain when computing arrival times
** DONE [#A] Finish porting to Python3
** TODO [#A] dt can be different in each sonic file
** TODO [#B] Shifting to the transmitter signal for each track
   May be different start-recording times and scaling
** TODO [#C] Better automated arrival picking
   idea: create lines base on color gradients (maybe Hough
   transform), make the user pick the line that corresponds
   to the arrivals and another that corresponds to transmitting.
* General
** TODO Make Windows executable
** TODO Write tutorial + methodology section
** TODO [#B] Make more elaborated README
   Add Images, usage tips and other stuff
** TODO [#C] Add license info to Readme
** TODO [#A] Add unit testing
        Also, figure out how to do it properly...
        1. make sure it doesn't break
        2. make sure arrival values are correct
** TODO [#A] Rename Colors.py into Styles.py
   and put all the stylystic things in there
   (such as LabelStyle in the dataviewer class)
** TODO [#A] ComboList styles in styles file
** DONE Logging instead of print commands
** TODO Mohr circles testing
