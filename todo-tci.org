** TODO [#A] dt can be different in each sonic file
** TODO [#B] Shifting to the transmitter signal for each track
   May be different start-recording times and scaling
** TODO [#C] Better automated arrival picking
   idea: create lines base on color gradients (maybe Hough
   transform), make the user pick the line that corresponds
   to the arrivals and another that corresponds to transmitting.
** TODO [#C] Better hand arrival picking
** TODO [#B] Computation of attenuation
** TODO [#A] Arrival-time algorithm widget appears after asking for arrival times
** TODO Account for strain when computing arrival times
* General
** TODO Make Windows executable
** TODO Write tutorial + methodology section
** TODO [#B] Make more elaborated README
   Add Images, usage tips and other stuff
** TODO [#C] Add license info to Readme
** TODO [#A] Add unit testing
        Also, figure out how to do it properly...
        1. make sure it doesn't break
        2. make sure arrival values are correct

** TODO [#A] Rename Colors.py into Styles.py
