* Sonic part
** [#B] dt can be different in each sonic file
** [#B] Shifting to the transmitter signal for each track
   May be different start-recording times and scaling
** [#C] Better automated arrival picking
   idea: create lines base on color gradients (maybe Hough
   transform), make the user pick the line that corresponds
   to the arrivals and another that corresponds to transmitting.
