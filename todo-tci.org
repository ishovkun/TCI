* Sonic part
** TODO [#A] dt can be different in each sonic file
** TODO [#B] Shifting to the transmitter signal for each track
   May be different start-recording times and scaling
** TODO [#C] Better automated arrival picking
   idea: create lines base on color gradients (maybe Hough
   transform), make the user pick the line that corresponds
   to the arrivals and another that corresponds to transmitting.
** TODO Add moduli/arrivals export
** TODO Autoscaling
** TODO Connect arrivals action
** Export arrival times

* General
** TODO Make Windows executable
** TODO Write tutorial + methodology section
** TODO [#A] Add unit testing
        Also, figure out how to do it properly...
        1. make sure it doesn't break
** TODO [#A] ComboList styles in styles file
** TODO Try to remove cursors when changing the data type or having
   checkboxes empty (to workaround the auto-zoom bug).
** Certain features activate appropriate tab
