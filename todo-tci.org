* Sonic part
** [#B] dt can be different in each sonic file
** [#B] Shifting to the transmitter signal for each track
   May be different start-recording times and scaling
** [#C] Better automated arrival picking
   idea: create lines base on color gradients (maybe Hough
   transform), make the user pick the line that corresponds
   to the arrivals and another that corresponds to transmitting.

** [#A] All actions need to work
** [#A] Add unit testing
** [#A] ComboList styles in styles file
** [#B] Write tutorial + methodology section
** [#B] Block tabs when no data in a new dataset
** [#C] Certain features activate appropriate tab
** [#C] Make Windows executable
** [#C] Try to remove cursors when changing the data type or having
   checkboxes empty (to workaround the auto-zoom bug).
** [#C] Tab drag (within bar) & close  (isMovable + tabClosable)
